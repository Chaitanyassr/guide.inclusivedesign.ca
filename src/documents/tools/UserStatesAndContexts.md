User states and contexts is a use-modelling tool for conceptualizing, designing, and evaluating the ability of a design to be consumed and operated by users in a wide range of states and contexts. This tool demonstrates all the many states and contexts users can be in at any given time and situation. It provides a way to determine common needs among users in different states and contexts.

A user states and context map can be used to demonstrate user needs that are represented by a particular persona, or that of a collection of personas. The map can also be used to consider how a userâ€™s state and context can change in the short term (e.g. on a daily basis) or the long term (e.g. over a lifetime). By demonstrating the many states and contexts a user can be in at any given time and in any given situation, the map presents a bigger picture. It describes the broad and ever-changing needs of a single user, and also allows a comparison of the needs of multiple users, thereby revealing patterns, interesting outliers, or commonalities in needs that might not otherwise be obvious.
