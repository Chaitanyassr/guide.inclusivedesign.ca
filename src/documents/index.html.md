The Inclusive Design Guidelines are made up of four sections:

* Principles
* Practices
* Tools
* Activities

The Principles describe the broad ideas and defining values of inclusive design. Each principle includes
links to one or more Practices, which describe specific ways you can put the principles of inclusive design
into action. Each practice includes links to a number of available Tools you can use in your inclusive
design process. Finally the Activities describe interesting and fun ways you can put it all together to apply
and learn more about the guidelines and about inclusive design.

The guidelines are not meant to be followed in any particular order. You can begin wherever and
whenever it makes sense for you, your team, and your process. Revisiting the guidelines at different
stages in the project can be an effective way to integrate them into your work.

You will find that these guidelines focus on the process of digital design. However, it is our desire to broaden
their scope to be applicable to the design of services, of the built environment and of physical products, as
well as processes like workshops, meetings, conferences, and even how we interact with one another on a
daily basis.

These guidelines should be usable by anyone, not just those working in “official” roles as designers or
developers. They are and will remain a work in progress. The concepts and methods captured within them
are ever-evolving as we all learn more about how to design inclusion into all that we do.
