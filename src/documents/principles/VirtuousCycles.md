The dynamics of connected and entangled global networks means that emerging technical practices can introduce not only opportunities and challenges, but also powerful virtuous cycles of digital inclusion. Addressing any factor in a complex system (e.g. the education system in a certain country) can cause an amplified and escalating reaction in other systems (e.g. the world economy).

Virtuous cycles of inclusion are triggered by following practices which in themselves are inclusive. First, by insisting on diverse participation from the start, the design and development process is more inclusive, inspiring innovation and resulting in products and services that meet more diverse needs.

When more diverse needs are met, individuals have greater access to participation and they can communicate their diverse demands. This pushes personalization into the mainstream, making inclusively designed products more affordable, thereby increasing individual spending power and prosperity, and further increasing access to participation.

At the same time, inclusive solutions make education more accessible to individuals with different needs, resulting in greater access to employment, which in turn increases individual spending power and and access to participation.
