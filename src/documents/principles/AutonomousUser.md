Allowing for personal discovery of needs and preferences is an important aspect of inclusive design. If an individual has never been exposed to something (e.g. changing settings on a digital device, or alternative learning or teaching methods), it is not enough to ask - what works for you? That is, if someone is unaware of an available solution, there is no way for that individual to know that it will help them, or to know where to find it or even to be motivated to to seek it out.

Designing for playful and engaging discovery in a low-risk environment creates a space for a user to learn about their own needs and preferences. In contrast, prescribing ways of interacting or learning based on medical diagnoses or other rigid categorizations or assumptions limits a userâ€™s choices and makes no space for the unexpected or for variations and nuances.

Wherever possible adaptability and flexibility should be designed into products and services. This puts more power into the hands of any one of us to create our own experience, and to modify this experience over time and/or in new contexts. Allowing for the sharing of information among users is another way to promote user autonomy; in this way an individual can depend on a growing community of people with similar interests and needs.

## Try
Think of one your latest projects. List some of the areas that you have made assumptions about user needs, and made a design decision based on those assumptions. Rethink your process and imagine how you would redesign your product differently if you were giving the user the power to make those decisions.
