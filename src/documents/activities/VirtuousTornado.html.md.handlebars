## Introduction &mdash; Innovation at the Edges

<figure>
[![The starburst plot shows a denser set of dots (representing the majority needs) in the centre, and more widely spaced dots the further you get from that centre (the minority needs). Distance represents difference. The closer the dots the more similar they are. The wider they are spaced from each other the more they differ. Design innovation happens at the outer edges. ](/images/VirtuousTornado01.png)](/images/VirtuousTornado01.png)
