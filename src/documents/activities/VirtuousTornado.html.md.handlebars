## Introduction &mdash; Innovation at the Edges

When we have limited time and resources, we tend to follow the 80/20 rule; to tackle the 80% (majority needs) first, and leave the most difficult 20% (minority needs) for later. However, change and innovation are found at the margins. Designing for the 20% might take more time and resources at first, but it will be dynamically resilient and adaptable, and will also cost less in the long term (read more at [If You Want the Best Design Ask Strangers to Help](https://medium.com/ontariodigital/if-you-want-the-best-design-ask-strangers-to-help-e37bdb73567)).

This activity helps to break away from the 80/20 rule to consider more diverse perspectives and needs. You can try this activity when designing something new or when critiquing an existing design. This activity is effective when a diverse set of co-designers, including people who presently have difficulty using the design or can't use the design, are active participants in the process. Before you begin, ask: who are we missing?

Consider a scatter-plot of the needs of any group of people. Everyone brings a variety of different ways of being and working, different skills and needs to the table. Consider where you might lie on the starburst when using a particular design.

Distance represents difference. The closer the dots the more similar they are. The wider they are spaced from each other the more they differ. Design innovation happens at the outer edges. ](/images/VirtuousTornado01.png)](/images/VirtuousTornado01.png)

## Identifying Needs - Mapping it Out

Consider and note the following for your design:
* The needs and characteristics of those who can use the design
* The needs and characteristics of those that have difficulty using it
* The needs and characteristics of those that can’t use the design

Map all of these needs and characteristics onto wedges or facets as shown in Figures 2 and 3. Use as many facets as you need to map all the needs and characteristics that you can think of. Place the needs that are met, representing people who can use the design with ease, in the center of the map. Place partially-met needs in the middle zone, representing people who have difficulty using the design. Place any unmet needs, representing people who cannot use the design, in the outer periphery of the map. Remember to consider your own needs in the process!

If you find it helpful, you can group the needs and characteristics into common themes and place these on individual facets, in order to help your team consider additional needs that may be associated with each theme. This grouping is not essential, and where you place each need is not critical - as long as the process you choose allows you to consider as many needs as possible.

## Iterating on the Design - The Virtuous Tornado

This activity will help your team address the needs that you have identified in the previous activity, and plan for future design iterations. You can start small; each time you circle around and up the spiral you will be stretching the design to encompass more and more needs, moving outward toward the edge of the starburst. As you do so, your design will become more and more generous. Here you will sustain the availability and the accessibility of prior iterations, but continue to stretch out to encompass more needs. If you are able to change your design to meet the needs of at least one additional person, you are moving in the right direction.

Rather than moving toward a single design solution, inclusive design is an iterative process that expands a design to encompass more possibility, more means of access, and more inclusive dimensions. In your groups, instead of competing to find THE single best design, we encourage you to come up with a diversity of choices.

At each cycle of iteration, we should ask “who are we missing?” What perspectives are not at the table and how can we design the table so that everyone can participate in our process? Bring in another person, another scenario, another set of needs and characteristic at each iteration cycle as you stretch out the design to encompass more needs. You can plan as many iteration cycles as  possible to ensure your design responds to diverse needs and characteristics.
