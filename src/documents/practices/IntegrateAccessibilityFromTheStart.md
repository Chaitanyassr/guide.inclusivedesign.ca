title: Integrate Accessibility From the Start

By considering accessibility and inclusion from the start of a
project, it is much easier to integrate accessibility features
into the design of the final product or service. Multiple
modes of interaction and access are best considered from
the beginning of the process. In this way both the
segregation of “special” solutions as well as expensive future
retro-fitting can be avoided.

For example, when designing a building, multiple modes of
physical access (stairs, ramp, door widths, etc) must be
considered in the early planning stages. The same approach
should be taken, for example, when designing a website. The
experience of a screen-reader user, or someone who may not
use a keyboard or mouse at all should be considered from
the start.

As designers, developers and others active in the design
process, becoming aware of our limited personal perspective
(e.g. prioritizing the visual impact of an interface) helps us to
understand and overcome our biases, which in turn keeps us
open to new ideas and innovative solutions.

## Try
* Develop personae and use-cases with a broad range of needs and preferences
* Practice co-design
* Test your designs early and often with a broad range of users
