The practice of co-design allows users to become active
participants in the design process by facilitating their direct
input into the creation of solutions that meet their needs,
rather than limiting users to the role of research subjects or
consultants. When a diverse group of users can participate
in the design process, a broader range of needs can be
considered throughout the process, from conception to
completion. The entire team can participate in quick testing
and feedback cycles, and design decisions can be made
more quickly.

When users whose needs are typically considered to be “at
the margins” are able to participate in the design process,
not only will their needs more likely be taken into account,
but the features that meet those needs can be smoothly
integrated into the final design. In this way, both the
segregation of “special” solutions as well as expensive future
retro-fitting can be minimized. Practicing co-design brings a
more flexible and wider perspective to the design process,
while incorporating insights from targeted communities.

## Try
* Invite “end-users” into the design process
* Use accessible design & development tools
* Provide ways for “non-designers” to easily access/sketch/share ideas
* Hire designers and others who themselves have a range of diverse needs
